# is601_mini_project3

My Final Project will be included in the "Posts" branch of this repo.

For my final feature, I created a library of posts in which every user that is registered in my app has access too. 

These Posts have randomly generated Images and randomly genertated URL's that link to real websites.  

In order to create my Library, I had to create a new Controller, Model, View, Factory, Migration, and Seeder.
